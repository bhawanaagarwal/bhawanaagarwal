### Hi there üëã
Ever wondered what it takes to carve your path from zero tech background to a career in programming?

It all started in 2016 when I did my first unpaid internship and secured my first job in 2017. Dreaming big, I expressed my ambition of becoming a data scientist to my manager. With his unwavering support, I embraced Python, shadowed a knowledgeable colleague, and smoothly glided into Data Science.

But hold on, the story doesn't end there. Feeling the need for more, I decided to level up in Machine Learning and Data Science. Packed my bags, landed in the US, and after two rollercoaster years, I proudly graduated in December 2023. Along the journey, I've found a passion for problem-solving that keeps me energized and motivated.<br>

My expertise spans a wide spectrum of technologies, cultivated through diverse experiences in both professional and academic settings. I am eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts, ready to share and expand our knowledge together. Let's embark on a journey of continuous learning and innovation!

Excited to connect with you,
Bhawana Agarwal üöÄ

## My Recent Works:

| Repository | Description |
|---|---|
| [Multiclass Image classification](https://github.com/bhawanaagarwal/Multi-image-Classification-CNN-) | Classified insects' images comprising 10 classes using CNN. This model is designed in such a way that one can use this model to classify images with any number of classes. (I like optimizing the codes and making them reusable.) |
| [Web Scrapping images from news article](https://github.com/bhawanaagarwal/Web-Scrapping/tree/main) | This notebook scrapes the article-relevant images, bypassing all the ads or other images in the news page
|[Precipitation Prediction](https://github.com/Neural-INFO-6106/PrecipitationPrediction.git) | ConvLSTM model to predict to effect of Lake Michigan on Traverse City's precipitation |
| [Text Prediction in Hindi](https://github.com/Neural-INFO-6106/HindiTextGenerator.git) | A sequence-to-sequence model trained on the "Story of Mirabai" dataset, leveraging IndicNLP for language processing tasks |
| [Image Captioning](https://github.com/Neural-INFO-6106/CoCo_Dataset.git) | An image captioning system using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) by leveraging pre-trained transfer values from a VGG16 model for image feature extraction  |
| [Emotion Recognition Model](https://github.com/Neural-INFO-6106/RecognitionModel.git) | An integrated gender and emotion recognition model through training on a diverse dataset of 58,000 images |
